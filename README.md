# PlantSpeciesDetectionUsingCNN
This project presents a study of performing plant 
species classification using Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs), which are a type of deep learning models. We have 
designed two CNN models from scratch, and compared their 
performance with a pre-existing CNN model. The two models 
were designed with a trial-and-error approach. The 
implementation of the models in the paper have been done using 
Python, using the keras module, which is part of TensorFlow 
library.
